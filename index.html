                                weird or strange in any way. For me, it was a good start. The more I got to know him I
                                realised,
                                how generous, kind, caring, and genuine he is as a person. I kept observing him in
                                situations
                                and even for the smallest of things he would be so considerate.

                                but
                                he turned it around. The honesty with which he looks at relationships. The respect and
                                trust
                                that he has in me. Honestly, I was not looking for more than this. He seems perfect.

                                    And knowing him now as this guy who is responsible and looks after his family so well. I must say that I have seen him grow or maybe not because he still might watch cartoons, play games and treasure his G. I Joe collection as he would years back. 
                                    Now that he is getting married, I hope he keeps a child in him alive. And I hope the passion for these little things never ever fades out.

                                    Fighting, falling out and coming together all over again. We have all grown together
                                    and seen each other almost through everything
                                    We have seen him when he was best and when he was at his vulnerable most. We have
                                    seen him building a life for himself and being there for his close ones. And we have
                                    also seen him through his blunders, goof ups and all the stupidity that he can do.
                                    Prasad marriage is an event that is a part of our life as much as it is of his.
                                    Can't wait for it. And by the way - Continue being as amazing as you always are.

                                    I vividly remember that our friendship was nowhere closer to being normal. We fought like cats and dogs, from pulling each other's hair to kicking each other's Butts. That's us, and I wouldn't want to change a bit about it.
                                    Its almost unreal how you have managed to find the prettiest wife after the face that you have got. Don't take this to your heart we truly believe its a SCAM2021.
                                    I was told to say good things and nice wishes to you so here you go, I might have not said this enough but you are a great friend and I am more than happy that you finally got a wonderful life partner. Lots of wishes.
